The Crypto currency market has been developed at an unprecedented speed over
the past few years. Cryptocurrency works similar to standard currency, however,
virtual payments are made for goods and services without the intervention of any
central authority. Although cryptocurrency ensures legitimate and unique transactions
by utilizing cryptographic methods, this industry is still in its inception and
serious concerns have been raised about its use. Analysis of the sentiments about
cryptocurrency is highly desirable to provide a holistic view of peoplesâ€™ perceptions.
For increasing the efficacy of the analysis, a deep learning ensemble model LSTMCNN
is proposed that combines two recurrent neural networks applications including
long short term memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). LSTM
and CNN are stacked where the CNN is trained on the features extracted by LSTM.
Utilizing term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, and bag of words
(BoW) features, several machine learning and deep learning approaches and a proposed
ensemble model are investigated. Furthermore, TextBlob and Text2Emotion
are studied for emotion analysis with the selected models. Comparatively, a larger
number of people feel happy with the use of cryptocurrency, followed by fear and
surprise emotions.
